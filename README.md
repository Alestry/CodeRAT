# What is CodeRAT?


CodeRAT is an open source chromium-based browser extension for GitHub code review analysis. It was developed as part of my bachelor's thesis at the University of Zurich.



# How to Install CodeRAT


Step 1 - Download or have a local copy of the repository on your computer.

Step 2 - Open the desired chromium-based browser.

Step 3 - Click on the three vertical dots in the upper right corner and then navigate to "More Tools" -> "Extensions".

Step 4 - In the upper right corner, toggle "Developer mode" on.

Step 5 - In the upper left corner, click on "Load unpacked" and navigate to the repository/folder on your computer where the extention resides.

Step 6 - Click on said folder and confirm with "Select Folder".

Done! The extension should now be locally installed.

Note: To allow for easier access to the CodeRAT's user interface, right-click the puzzle icon called "Extensions" in the upper right corner of your browser and click the pin icon next to CodeRAT.
