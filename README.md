# How to Install the Plugin in Google Chrome


Step 1 - Download or have a local copy of the repository/folder on your computer

Step 2 - Open Google Chrome

Step 3 - Click on the three vertical dots in the upper right corner and then navigate to "More Tools" -> "Extensions"

Step 4 - In the upper right corner, toggle "Developer mode" on

Step 5 - In the upper left corner, click on "Load unpacked" and navigate to the repository/folder on your computer where the extention resides

Step 6 - Click on said folder and confirm with "Select Folder"

Done! The extension should now be locally installed.

Note 1: Currently the extension is only set to work on the github.com/* domain

Note 2: When there is a new version of the extention, it is not necessary to go through all these steps again. It is enough to go to the "Extensions" page and click the refresh button in the extension's panel
